France have been named host of Rugby World Cup 2023 despite finishing second to South Africa in a technical review. South Africa had been recommended by World Rugby’s Board but the Council members voted for France in what many claim is unprecedented  Cabinet on Thursday congratulated France on being named as the host of the 2023 Rugby World Cup. “Cabinet congratulates France as the preferred host of the 2023 Rugby World Cup,” said Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane. At a post Cabinet media briefing held in Cape Town, Minister Kubayi-Ngubane thanked government’s delegation -- headed by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Sport and Recreation Minister Thulas Nxesi and the South African Rugby Union -- for the work done in promoting South Africa’s bid to host the event. South Africa, France and Ireland had been in the running to host the 10th edition of the tournament. Chairperson of World Rugby and Rugby World Cup, Bill Beaumont, made the announcement in London on Wednesday.  The ceremony was attended by Deputy President Ramaphosa and his delegation. Beaumont thanked the host candidates for their bids. “We set out on this host selection process with the objective of selecting a host that would deliver an outstanding Rugby World Cup in every way. Within their bids all host candidates demonstrated that they could deliver a truly exceptional tournament for teams and fans. “We believe that this is the most comprehensive and transparent host selection process ever undertaken by World Rugby,” said Beaumont. In September, Deputy President Ramaphosa, led the Rugby World Cup Bid Team SA, when it presented its case to host the 2023 tournament that will take place 200 years after the invention of the game of rugby by William Webb Ellis.           South Africa previously hosted the World Cup in 1995
