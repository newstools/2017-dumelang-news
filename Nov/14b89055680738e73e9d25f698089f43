Njabulo Ndlovu celebrating one of his goals. Celebrations after goal.  Registration for the 2018 edition of the largest soccer tournament in the world for kids between 10 and 12 years is open.  Schools across the country are invited to become part of the Danone Nations Cup.  South Africa has been participating in the tournament since its inception and has won the world title three times: in 2003, 2007 and 2009. The tournament is run in partnership with the South African Schools Football Association (SASFA) and it comprises games beginning at cluster level, with winning schools progressing to regional and then provincial levels, culminating in the national finals where the national champion team that will represent the country at the Danone Nations Cup World Finals is identified. Last year, over 2 700 schools registered to play in the initial rounds of the tournament, which is the most to have registered in the history of the tournament in this country. The Danone Nations Cup is built on fundamental principles: participation, friendship, accessibility and fair play. The message is to believe in your dreams and to promote healthy living through sport to as many people as possible in the world. The eventual 2018 South African national champion team will be going to the Danone Nations Cup World Finals at a venue still to be decided. To register for the tournament please contact Themba Tshabalala at SASFA: thembatshabalala@saschoolsfa.co.za or 072 588 4957.
