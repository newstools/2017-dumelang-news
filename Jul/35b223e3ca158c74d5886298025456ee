Thaba-Nchu born music promoter has shown his business acumen by creatively introducing mala-mohodu and Pap at Platinum lounge every single Mondays.The club is situated at a busy small street in Willows but despite most clubs at the street catering for younger varsity students, Platinum lounge is exclusively for mature revellers aged 25 years and above. Gao Mokone said he made it deliberately for the posh club to cater for a more mature crowd that understand the entertainment night life. He said he decided to offer free mala-mohodu with Pap on Mondays so that people could have a different experience at the beginning of the week while enjoying their liquor and old school music ranging from RnB, Old school Hip-Hop and house when the night gets older."Platinum lounge is a lounge and restaurant focusing on entertainment featuring premier djs such as Divine Dj, Show D, LeGoody and Veenushka for detox sessions and to also offer our customers a free plate of mala-mogodu. as an outlet we want to give more focus to middle class people by giving a qaulity premium qaulity experience," said Mokone.Mokone said his experience in the entertainment industry has made him realise that there was a need for an entertainment on Mondays unlike what many people do over the weekends. He said Monday was a day to relax and unwind with cool music delivered by heavy hitters in the industry that he has chosen.
