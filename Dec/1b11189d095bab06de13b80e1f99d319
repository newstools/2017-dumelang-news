On Friday the Eskom board confirmed that it had received a report on a disciplinary hearing into  former CEO Matshela Koko. Eskom has denied reports that Koko will be back at work on Monday after being reinstated at the power utility’s CEO. It is focused on the very large tenders that, under his watch, went to a company that his daughter is linked to. The board would not disclose details of the outcome of the hearing, but it was understood Koko had been cleared of all charges. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says he’s not sure whether the reports are correct or not. “All I know is that the board members say they have not read the document and therefore cannot make any recommendations. We have noted the media reports that a suggesting that Koko will be coming back tomorrow.” “The board will from on Monday be going through the document and after that they will report back to the Minister of Public Enterprises as to what the recommendations, it’s only then that they will make the verdict to the public.”
