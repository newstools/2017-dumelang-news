The African National Congress (ANC) officially kicks off its 54th national Conference today (Saturday).  Among the expected outcomes of the five day conference is the election of a new executive that will lead the organisation for the next five years.There has been fierce contestation between seven presidential candidates that seek to succeed President Jacob Zuma, with two front-runners, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and former African Union Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (both pictured above) having emerged leading the battle. This weekend’s conference will go down in history with at least  two women vying to be at the helm of the organisation and possibly lead the country.The conference comes against the backdrop of provincial  conferences which have been  marred by numerous controversies  and court battles, which include KZN and the Free State. The ANC Secretary General, Gwede Mantashe said on Friday while briefing the media that final results of the conference will be out on early Sunday.
