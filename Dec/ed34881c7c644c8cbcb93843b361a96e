Despite losing to eventual cup winners, New Zealand, in the semi-final of the Cape Town leg of the World Rugby Sevens Series last week, the South Africans had something to celebrate in Seabelo Senatla's milestone.  Playing in his 35th Sevens tournament, the 24-year-old Senatla gave the hosts something to smile about when he slotted his 200th try against France, joining the likes of England's Dan Norton (272) and Kenyan Collins Injera (246), amongst others, who have also hit the double century mark. The Welkom-born speedster - playing in his 175th match - became the first South African to achieve this milestone, which he described as special. “It's amazing to say I scored 200 tries, but for me it was about what was next," the Stormers' winger said.  He added: "I think it's special to be able to have the privilege to play in the team like this [Blitzboks]. You win personal accolades, but we don't take it too much into heart because we allow ourselves to think about the team and not individuals." The Blitzboks headed to the Mother City at the back of a stellar performance which won them the Dubai leg in the opening round of this year's Series earlier this month. Hoping to continue with the positive momentum, the hosts got off to a flying start, but only settled for a bronze medal at the end, with a win against Canada. Senatla and Co finish the year at the second spot in the overall Series standings, with 39 points. The third leg of the Series gets under way on 26-28 January 2018 in Sydney, Australia.
