A dispute over "missing" votes will be debated in the ANC's first plenary session on Tuesday, a day after the party's 54th elective conference elected a new top six. To clarify, there were 68 delegates that did not vote at all for various reasons. Those non-votes are not in dispute. The dispute centres around a further 63 votes that were "quarantined". These were delegates that did cast ballots, but whose names were not found on the voters' roll. North West African National Congress  (ANC) Chairperson Supra Mahumapelo has warned backers of Senzo Mchunu, who narrowly lost the election for ANC Secretary General, not to push for the inclusion of 68 alleged missing votes. Ace Magashule won the Secretary-General post by only 24 votes. Electoral officials allegedly told 68 delegates that they did not appear on the voters’ roll. Mahumapelo says if any call for a complete rerun is entertained, it will plunge the entire ANC Elective Conference into disarray. He says: “As a province we met with our delegates that they must accept and live with the results but we are surprised that some people are raising complaints about the outcome.” “The are two risks, one is that you can’t just call for recounting of one position because you don’t know who voted how because this is a secret ballot. It means it will have to be for all officials in the NEC.” “The other risk is that they are pushing the organisation to say there must be a re-run for all officials of the ANC and I don’t know if we want to do that. If you can come to plenary, I can assure now we have a mandate from our delegates this morning, we must call for a re-run of all the Top Six officials,” says Mahumapelo. Chief whip Jackson Mthembu put a post out on social media at 6:40am eluding to this ‘missing’ vote saga verse running it through the available structures. With the ANC talking unity throughout the conference one might be inclined to believe that this goes against that ideal.
