Suspended Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille received  an extension until Tuesday for her to explain to the Democratic Alliance (DA) why she should not resign as Cape Town Mayor. She must also provide details why she should not remain suspended from the party’s activities. DA National spokesperson Phumzile van Damme says, “The DA Federal Executive established a sub-committee chaired by John Steenhuizen which had the role to look into those challenges. That sub-committee has now finished its work and tabled a report before the Federal Executive. Based on the contents of that report, the Federal Executive was of the opinion that the Mayor of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille, be suspended from party activities, to allow for further investigations.” De Lille says the DA furnished her with reasons for her suspension but she believes that the reasons do not warrant her suspension or removal. She says she will approach the courts if the DA decides to remove her. De Lille’s been suspended by the party’s Federal Executive following allegations of tender irregularities and maladministration in the City of Cape Town.
