Orlando Pirates suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Ea Lla Koto at Goble Park Stadium in Bethlehem that saw the home side move into third place on the standings, while the Soweto giants dropped to fifth. Despite boasting a host of goal scoring opportunities, the Sea Robbers conceded first when Sinethemba Jantjie forced an own goal from Abbubaker Mobara 10 minutes after the break. Thabiso Kutumela levelled the scoring five minutes later but Sredojevic and his charges were dealt a sucker punch when Jantjie netted a 84th minute winner against the run of play. "In a game of football you have one easy thing and one difficult thing. The hard thing is to dominate to possess and attack against the numbers and to look to get results. The easiest is to defend in numbers against the run of play to get [the results]," Sredojevic said after the game. "We take six points in this Boxing Day it's fantastic. We could have killed the game earlier with counter-attacks like we did against SuperSport. But I have to recognise that Pirates had two or three good chances, my goalkeeper made good saves. But the one who is more clinical will win.
