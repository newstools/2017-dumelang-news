Luc Eymael's men moved into the top eight following a shock 1-0 win over Matsatsantsa at Goble Park on Wednesday night Free State Stars returned to winning ways, thanks to Siphelele Mthembu's first half strike which was enough to see off SuperSport United in Bethlehem.  “Our win against Supersport was great and  it has lifted our spirits high as we face another difficult match against Pirates,” said Methembu.Ea Lla Koto moved into sixth position on the log, leaving their Tshwane opponents lingering outside the top eight.  Stars have certainly bounced back after their 3 nil thrashing at the hands of neighbours, Bloem Celtic last weekend.  It goes without saying that a win against the Sea Robbers this weekend would be a great desire for team and fan alike to end 2017 on  a high. Orlando Pirates are likely to miss the services of midfielder Thabo Qalinge for the Absa Premiership clash against Free State Stars due to injury. Pirates have certainly been playing well but seem to be challenged in finding the back of the net.  Meanwhile, Nkosinathi Mthiyane has een ruled out of the game against Free State Stars. Mthiyane, who came off the bench to play the last 10 minutes in Orlando Pirates’ 1-1 draw with AmaZulu, injured his quad earlier in the week and will need to undergo physiotherapy to treat his injury. The PSL meanwhile announced on Thursday that it finally found Pirates guilty after their fans rioted at the game against Sundowns in February . The PSL said sanctions will only be imposed in the new year.
