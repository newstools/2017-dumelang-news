Delighted ANC members celebrated the outcome of the new Top 6, saying it’s a real reflection of unity. The celebration comes after Cyril Ramaphosa was announced as the 14th ANC President. Cyril Ramaphosa secured 2440 of the votes, to become the next President of the African National Congress (ANC), at the party’s 54th National Conference on Monday. He beat competitor, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who could clinched 2261 of the votes during the election. Officials confirmed that 4708 of the 4776 delegates voted in this election. David Mabuza was voted in as the new Deputy President of the African National Congress, beating outsider Lindiwe Sisulu to the position. Ace Magashule became the new Secretary-General of the ANC, beating Senzo Mchunu to the position. Magashule regarded by many as a party man will relish the move to Luthuli house from Bloemfontein. The Deputy Secretary-General position was retained by Jessie Duarte. While Paul Mashatile is the new Treasurer-General of the ANC with 2517 votes. Traffic had come to a standstill around Nasrec as hundreds of ANC delegates were dancing with music playing from loud speakers. Cars are also hooting as a sign of showing support for the happy ANC members. One song that is constantly being sung here is ‘On your marks – get set we are ready for Ramaphosa’. Some of the people in Nasrec say that from here all roads will lead to Vilakazi in Soweto. Even though there are some members who say they were supporting Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to take the top position, they too were celebrating. Many saying in the end the ANC is the winner.
