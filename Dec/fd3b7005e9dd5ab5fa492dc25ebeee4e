President Jacob Zuma says he will approach the Supreme Court of Appeal, to appeal a High Court ruling that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should be the one to appoint a new National Director of Public Prosecutions. President Jacob Zuma appeals ruling that invalidated Shaun Abrahams appointment on essentially one ground: Court is wrong, he says, for putting all his powers re NDPP in hands of Deputy President. It's not "constitutionally permissible" for SA to have two Presidents. The Pretoria High Court last week found that Zuma cannot appoint a new prosecutions boss because he is conflicted in the matter. The court gave Ramaphosa 60 days to appoint a new NPA head after judges found the appointment of Shaun Abrahams as NPA boss was invalid and should be set aside. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance has accused President Jacob Zuma of committing perjury. The Democratic Alliance says it will today lay criminal charges of perjury against President Jacob Zuma following two high court judgments against him. The judgment also stipulated that the President should personally bear the costs of the litigation. DA leader Mmusi Maimane says in similar vein, Zuma should be prepared to pay from his own pockets should he decide to appeal Fridayâ€™s judgment. Some experts estimate those charges to amount to about R1.5m
