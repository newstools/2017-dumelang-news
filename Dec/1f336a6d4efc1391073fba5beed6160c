England failed to cash in on centuries from Jonny Bairstow and Dawid Malan as familiar problems persisted on a fluctuating second day in the third Ashes Test.Joe Root called for "special" contributions and a sustained overall performance as England's campaign approaches a tipping point in Perth, with the urn already on the line at 2-0 down in the five-match series. Malan's 140 and Bairstow's 119 served up the quality in an England Ashes record fifth-wicket stand of 237. But then after the tourists lost their last six wickets for 35 in their first-innings 403 all out, Steve Smith's 92 not out and Usman Khawaja's 50 helped Australia to 203 for three at stumps. Smith was flawless and batted on another level, despite minor vagaries of bounce already as cracks began to appear at the WACA.
