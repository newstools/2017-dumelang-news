According to Bloemfontein Celtic’s website Serbian mentor Veselin Jelušic won’t be on the bench when his charges play a crucial game against Mamelodi Sundowns this Saturday (16th December 2017). The much talked about tactician jetted out to his native country to renew his Uefa A coaching licence. “It is the policy of Uefa for coaches to renew their licences at a certain period of time,” explained Celtic CEO, Khumbulani Konco. “Veselin’s certificate is due for renewal and unfortunately he had to leave at this critical stage. The positive thing is that his mentorship has allowed his assistants to learn through proper guidance and I can guarantee that his absence won’t entirely affect the team. Yes, his leadership and presence are paramount, but again, we have two phenomenal coaches in both John Maduka and Lehlohonolo Seema.”coach Veselin will be available for Celtic’s last match for the year against SuperSport, to be played at Dr. Molemela stadium next week Wednesday (20th December 2017).
