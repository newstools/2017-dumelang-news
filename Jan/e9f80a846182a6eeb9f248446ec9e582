THABONG - Seabelo Senatla, a world acclaimed Welkom-born sevens rugby star, recently brought cheers to scores of underprivileged children in Thabong. On 30 December 2016, Senatla handed out sets of new clothes to several needy children at Thabong SAPS.The programme was a joint venture with the SAPS Visible Policing, with Colonel Pule Solo arranging the meeting with the children who were identified from police sector profiles. Speaking at the handover ceremony, Senatla said he decided to give out the clothing out as a way of remembering where he came from. If you forget where you come from, you will probably lose yourself. I want to use all my achievements as a platform to be a blessing to others. I need to share with others to put smiles on their faces, said the Springbok Sevens star who's stock has continued to rise over the past couples of years. The highlights of Senatla s achievements include being selected as the World Rugby Sevens player for 2016, SA Rugby Player of the Year 2016 as well as winning a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics 2016 with the Springbok Sevens side. Col Solo thanked Senatla for his kindness and remembering that there are children who are disadvantaged. We need community members such as Seabelo who give out of compassion to those in need, concluded Solo.
