BLOEMFONTEIN The New Year has started on a bad footing as motorists woke up on Wednesday 04 January 2017 to the news of fuel prices having been hiked by 50 cents and 39cents per litre of petrol and diesel respectively. The Department of Energy announced the hike, which took effect on 04 January, and attributed the recent adjustment to an increase in the price of the commodity on the global market as well as the fluctuation in the value of the currency. The recent increase sees 93 ULP and LRP costing 50 cents more per litre with 95 ULP and LRP going up by 48 cents a litre.Motorists will pay 39cents more per litre of diesel (0.05% sulphur) while those using diesel (0.005% sulphur) will now have to budget for 37cents more per every litre of the commodity. The price of illuminating paraffin has also not been spared with the wholesale price going up by 43 cents per litre while the commodity now costs 58cents more per litre in retail. The price hike is expected to have a negative ripple effect on the price of basic commodities as well as taxi fares. Speaking to the media after the announcement of the increase, South Africa National Taxi Council spokesperson, Thabisho Molelekwa, said a national executive meeting would be called to discuss a possible increase in taxi fares. There might be an increase in taxi fares in some areas but it would not be immediate as the association was aware of consumers financial difficulties, Molelekwa said.According to Molelekwa, areas where taxi fares were increased last year are expected to be spared from the impending fare adjustment.
