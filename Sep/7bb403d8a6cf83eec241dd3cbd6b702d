After successfully hosting the Kyoshinkan Karate National Championships that were held in Mangaung's Dr Molema Indoor Sports Ground last month, Bloemfontein based Sempai Kabelo Sebotsa, who is currently holding the black belt first degree in shodan, is planning to host self-defence classes for women. But he believes that an initiative of that magnitude will need thorough planning with also sufficient support from stakeholders such as local and provincial government as well as the private sector.He says such an initiative is a dream that he had a long time ago but needed to do all the ground work to ensure that he was ready, both mentally and physically and he believes that now is the right time.“It has always been my dream to embark on such a project, however, I needed to prove to myself and my critics that I can first pull off the Kyoshinkan Karate National Championships which I did on a small budget having to accommodate participants from other countries like  Zimbabwe and Namibia,” said Sebotsa.He said he attributes the success of the championships to partnerships that he had with local non-profit organisations like the Restore and Rehabilitate Foundations chaired by Masilo Mohapi which assisted in identifying sponsors in order to make the event a success. It was for the first time in its history, the Kyoshinkan Karate National Championships were held in the city of roses where everything is at the heart.About his new venture, Sebotsa said he will need a suitable venue, equipment and marketing of the project, and these resources would cost less than R10 000.“Our women are often faced with serious challenges of being attacked by strangers who also target them and rob them and in serious circumstances are even raped and killed. Sometimes these can be prevened by simply applying easy self-defence tricks that a woman can use and that is where me and my team come in,” he added.Lately, South Africa’s crime statistics on women attacks have been in the spotlight and initiatives such as these can come in handy but with the right resources and support, Sebotsa believes.He invites stakeholders to come on board and can be contacted on 0761666801.
