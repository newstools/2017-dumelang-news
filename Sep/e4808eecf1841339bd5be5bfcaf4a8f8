Following their stellar performance to claim their first win of the Guinness Pro14 championship against the Zebre, the Cheetahs will be looking for the same momentum when they host Leinster on Friday. Kickoff at the Toyota Stadium is at 8 pm. The Cheetahs became the first South African side to win a Pro14 match when they brushed aside the Italian side (54-39) to clinch their first home victory of the season. The win was not only well received by those associated with the orange and white side, but the man at the helm, Rory Duncan. With the first win out of the way, Duncan said it was vital to boost the players' confidence and are now targeting continuity. "We wanted to get a win under a belt to boost players confidence as well," he told Dumelang Sport. "It's important moving forward. And also home ground advantage." He added: "After two tough games on tour, to come back home and see the guys fight the way they did. Continuity is important for our side; we haven't played much as a group." "We're growing game by game, so it's great," added captain, Francois Venter. Next on the Cheetahs plate are Leinster, who are unbeaten so far this season with three wins in as many matches. With both sides high in confidence, the clash promises to be a thriller. “They're a quality outfit. We'll have to prepare well and be geared up for what these guys are going to throw at us. It's going to be a tough game, but our guys are ready for it,” Duncan concluded. Also looking for some positive results are the Currie Cup defending champions, the Free State Cheetahs, who return to action following a week of the bye. The second-placed Cheetahs lock horns with the Pumas, desperately looking for maximum points having last tasted a win in August against the Lions in their last home match. Since then they have gone to lose to the Sharks and the Western Province and they now find themselves 14 points behind the former. The match will come before the Pro14 clash, at 5:30 pm.
